  |   You, your friends and a ticking bomb. Work together and see how       |
  |   many people you can save!                                             |

  |   A text message leads you to a ticking bomb. Tick-tock! Tick-tock!     |
  |   Every second counts. Which wire to cut - the blue or the red one?     |
  |   How to set the control knobs? Tick-tock! Tick-tock! Only two          |
  |   minutes left... Your flashlight battery runs out. The adrenaline      |
  |   kicks in. Will you keep a cool head and defuse the bomb?              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   WARNING: Time pressure and adrenaline may lead to shouting,           |
  |   swearing, and misunderstandings, which can cause temporary            |
  |   resentment between friends or silent treatment from loved ones!       |

  |   One of the players takes on the role of the Unlikely Hero, who        |
  |   finds a bomb and tries to defuse it. The hero is the only player      |
  |   who uses the console. The other players become the Expert Team and    |
  |   they have access to the bomb defusal manual. They cannot see what     |
  |   the Unlikely Hero sees on the screen, and the hero cannot see the     |
  |   contents of the manual.                                               |
